# CVS Health Search Tool
## A web-scraping bot that searches through CVS Health for articles matching specific keywords. 
CVS Health’s webpage did not have a native search bar at the time, so this bot made it easier for my grandfather to read specific articles.
  - Utilized Python’s BeautifulSoup library to grab data directly from CVS Health
